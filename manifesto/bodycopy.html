<p><strong>Let me tell you a story &hellip;</strong></p>
<p>It begins in a small, poorly lit room, perhaps at the back of a small house or tenement. A small lamp provides the only illumination above an old, overstuffed recliner. Soft, instrumental music drifts along the edges of the shadows.</p>
<p>A floorboard creaks somewhere in the darkness. A head turns and a lone reader peers over his dog-eared paperback, eyes searching the darkness for an unseen intruder.</p>
<p>"I...is someone there?" squeaks the reader, only to be greeted by silence.</p>
<p>Just the house shifting ... or a killer waiting in the darkness?</p>
<p>Silence. The soft murmur of a piano from an unseen record player.</p>
<p>Slowly, the reader returns to his paperback novel, but glances once again into the darkness, unsure.</p>
<p><strong>How does this story end?</strong></p>
<p>Is the poor reader about to be interrupted ... for the last time? Or is it his imagination, the villain from his novel lurking not in the darkness of his room, but in the shadows of his imagination?</p>
<p>	We've all been there. Most of the time, it's just your mind projecting the thrills and mystery of your murder mystery novel into the seams of reality. And it's that titillation that keeps you glued to the pages&mdash;seeking one more clue, one more tidbit of information&mdash;far past your bedtime.</p>
<p>The best stories continue to haunt us, their deeper messages resonating in our minds and in our hearts long after we've passed <em>THE END</em> and moved on with our normal lives. We read murder mysteries because of the thrill, the puzzle, the desire to bring justice to a world that is so often unjust.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite murder mystery story?</strong></p>
<p>Do you remember the first murder mystery you read? Was it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiell_Hammett">Dashiell Hammett's</a>	<em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, perhaps the only detective novel read in any literature class. Or maybe you grew up reading Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys. Maybe you read your father's <em>Black Mask</em> or <em>Detective Stories Magazine</em>. Maybe it was a ragged paperback sitting on your parent's bookshelf that caught your eye.</p>
<p>	Mary Roberts Rinehart. Cleve F. Adams. Ben Benson. J. J. Marric. Helen Reilly. Agatha Christie. S.S. Van Dine. Walter Wager. Craig Rice. Dean Spencer. Matthew Blood. James Hadley Chase.</p>
<p><em>Who was your favorite author?</em></p>
<p>Remember how they made you feel? Remember how you looked forward to losing yourself in the mystery, racing the detective to figure out how killed the victim?</p>
<p>What if you could recapture that feeling? What if you could find those great hardboiled, noir, cozy, classic or police procedural stories that you loved? What if you had countless murder mystery stories at your fingertips, just waiting for you to pick them up and turn to <em>Chapter One</em>?</p>
<p><strong>But, there's a problem.</strong></p>
<p>	The simple fact is, except for the collection you may have stashed away in your attic or the few, random, worn copies you might find at a used bookstore or on eBay, these stories are slowly disappearing. Old pulp novels, whatever the sub-genre, are being replaced by new books. Glossy tomes about modern	crimes-computer fraud, international terrorism, identity theft-vie for our attention.</p>
<p>And the old classic murder mysteries disappear. Why? Because they don't, again with rare exception, don't meet the criteria for literary status. Ben Benson isn't Mark Twain or William Shakespeare or even Dashiell Hammett.</p>
<p>So they are relished to attics and forgotten collections. Lost to new generations of readers because we just let their stories slip from our minds. Because these stories aren't worthy of preservation.</p>
<p>That's the general consensus.</p>
<p>	<strong>We don't agree.</strong></p>
<p>At <strong>TalesofMurder.com</strong>, and through our parent company, <strong>Tales of Murder Press, LLC</strong>, we seek to preserve these great works of literature and enable a new generation of readers to discover the thrills and excitement we knew as we read so many great murder mystery stories.</p>
<p>	<strong>Tales of Murder Press </strong>	is a small, independent publisher that republishes out-of-print and rare murder mystery novels and short stories in multiple formats (ebook, paperback,	collectors' edition hardbacks, collections, illustrated &amp; graphic novel editions, and audiobooks). The purpose of this venture is to (1) preserve these	classic stories and make sure they are not lost, and (2) introduce a new generation of readers to these classic works.</p>
<p>We believe that these books and short stories represent an overlooked genre of classic American and British literature. Through the rerelease of these	stories and writing/publishing critical reviews of the works we will demonstrate the literary merit of these works.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>	And that, simply, is our mission: to preserve these great works of literature and honor their authors by proving the literary merit of their work.</p>
<p>Join us on this journey, and help Tales of Murder Press keep these great authors alive through the continued and ongoing redistribution and reading of	their works.</p>
